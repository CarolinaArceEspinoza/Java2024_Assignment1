## Project Description:
The objective of this project is to develop a Graphical User Interface (MVC Structure) that enables users to retrieve information from a MySQL database and present it as chart data. The MySQL database must be accessible remotely.

By leveraging JavaFX and MySQL integration, this project provides an interactive platform for exploring and analyzing data related to Marvel Cinematic Universe characters.

The project was developed utilizing Intellij IDEA, JDK 17, and JavaFX.
